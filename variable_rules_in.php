<!-- // a variable starts with a $ sign -->
 <?php
 $name = "himanshu";// $name is a variable

 $age = 23; // $age is a variable

 $_subject = "php"; // $_subject is also a variable;
 
 echo  "my name is $name and my age is $age";// so we are using double quotes so that it can print the value of variables;
